# Caitlyn's Codecakes
Teaching Python to your own middle school kids. Designed
for a 12 year old girl. These lessons are used with 
[these videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxvyAnoL-vu5sNgzos6_v6nX-j8N4H-Pd).
The videos are based on drills.
These lessons provide more explanation on theory, as
requested by my daughter.

You should go through the videos prior to attempting these lessons.

## Learning Objectives

### [Lesson 1 - Image](lesson1.md)

#### Challenge

- Place 5 images on screen

#### Learning Objectives

- infinite while loop
- x, y coordinate system
- variable assignment

### [Lesson 2 - Move](lesson02.md)

#### Challenge

- Place 1 image on screen and make it move automatically
    - you do not need to build a controller
    - as soon as the game starts, the character moves
    - you do not need to implement bounds detection

#### Learning Objectives

- increment (in while loop)
- bounds detection and handling


### [Lesson 3 - Control](lesson03.md)


#### Challenge
- Place 1 character on screen and make it move in all four directions
- Set up bounds detection
- build virtual controller using four images of arrows (right, left, up, down)
- when a player clicks on each arrow, make the character (guffy) move in the proper direction

#### Learning Objectives

- event loop (for loop)
- if statements

### [Lesson 4 - Chase](lesson04.md)

### [Lesson 5 - Text](text.md)

### [Lesson 6 - Timer](timer.md)

### [Lesson 7 - Level](level.md)
